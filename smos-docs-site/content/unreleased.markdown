### Changed

`smos` and `smos-query`: Consider the `END` timestamp exclusive for the purpose of the ongoing report.
`smos-data`: Documented the meaning of common timestamp names.
`smos-calendar-import`: Improved the ICAL parsing so that invalidly `TEXT`-encoded `URL` properties can still be parsed. 
`smos`: Replace `[+]` by `[unsaved changes]`.
`smos`: Added style (colour) to the editor header text.
`smos-calendar-import`: Retry http requests.
