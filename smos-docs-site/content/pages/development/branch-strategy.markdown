title: Branching Strategy
description: An overview of how we use git branches in the smos repository
---

The default branch of the repository is `release`, which points to the latest release.

There are three more relevant branches:

* `staging`, which points to whatever is in the staging environment.
* `testing`, which points to whatever is in the staging environment.
* `development`, which points to the latest commit. When contributing, this is the version that you should make your pull request to.

We don't use a `master` branch.
