Smos is currently developed on Linux.
It _should_ "just work" on MacOS.
It _should_ "just work" on Windows' subsystem for linux.
It probably won't work on Windows as-is. (See [Issue 52](https://github.com/NorfairKing/smos/issues/52))

* [Stack](/installation/stack)
* [Nix](/installation/nix)
* [Windows](/installation/windows)
* [NixOS](/installation/nixos)


If you'd like to try smos out _and_ you have `nix` installed, you can "just" run this:

```
nix run github:NorfairKing/smos
```
