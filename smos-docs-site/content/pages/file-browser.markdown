Smos has a built-in file browser for easy navigation within your workflow.
You can find the keybindings to enter the file browser [under the 'Any' section of the keybindings page](/smos/keybindings#Any) or by searching for `browser` in the built-in help mode.

From here, you can switch between files and archive files.

<div id="cast"></div>
<script src=/assets/asciinema-player.js></script>
<script>
  AsciinemaPlayer.create('/casts/browser.cast', document.getElementById('cast'), {
    autoPlay: true,
    preload: true,
    loop: true,
  });
</script>
