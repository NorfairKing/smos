description: Documentation for the Smos Calendar Import Tool, for importing your calendar into Smos
---

This tool exists to import your calendar from an external source into Smos.

<asciinema-player
  src="/casts/calendar-import.cast"
  autoplay="true"
  preloop="true"
  loop="true">
  </asciinema-player>

Make sure to run it periodically.

Note that you can also ignore specific events while importing, by adding `SMOS_NO_CALENDAR_IMPORT` to their description.


See [the instructions for running it on NixOS](/smos-calendar-import/nixos) for automation for that on NixOS.
