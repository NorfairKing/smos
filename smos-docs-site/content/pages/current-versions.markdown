Smos' data format and API are versioned.

On this page you can find the current version and supported versions of the latest release.

To integrate with smos files, make sure to read [the documentation page about the format](/smos/file).
To integrate with the smos server, make sure to read [the documentation page about the server API](/smos-server).


## Meaning of the version components

* Major version component: If the version is not supported, interactions will fail.
* Minor version component: If the version is not supported, interactions will succeed but may be missing data that isn't defined in older versions.
* Patch version component: Unused.
