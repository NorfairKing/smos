### Changed

* `smos-scheduler`:
  When a rent recurrence schedule is activated the first time, it is activated
  as if the current time is the time it would have been activated next.

* Home manager module: The `workflowDir` option is now put into the smos config
  file, instead of only used for the backup script.

* `smos-server`:
  Use the default compression level (3) for compressing backups instead of the
  maximum level (24).

* `smos`:
  Fixed a bug in which the directory could not be switched if the target had
  the same contents (empty) as the currently selected directory.
