# Smos

A semantic tree-based editor to replace Emacs Org Mode

## What is Smos?

### A replacement for emacs org mode

Smos intends to deprecate Emacs org mode by being more robust, more
customisable, by providing a better and more tool-friendly file
format and by using a more sane configuration language.

### Completely customisable

Smos is first and foremost a library with which you can build your own version.
It is similar to XMonad in this respect.
See [the default configuration](smos/src/Smos/Default.hs)
for an example of a configuration.

### Future-proof file format

The Smos file format (`.smos`) is completely future proof because it is just
a subset of YAML:

![Example](assets/smos.png)

``` smos
- entry:
    header: Use Smos
    timestamps:
      DEADLINE: 2018-10-30
      SCHEDULED: 2018-10-20
    state-history:
    - new-state: STARTED
      timestamp: 2018-10-10 14:19:53.988042844000+0000
    tags:
    - online
  forest:
  - header: Don't mess it up
    state-history:
    - new-state: DONE
      timestamp: 2018-10-10 14:19:54.388413954000+0000
  - header: Be smart about it
    state-history:
    - new-state: TODO
      timestamp: 2018-10-10 14:19:54.796427564000+0000
    tags:
    - work
```

This format is very easy to work with programmatically, and convenience
functions in the `smos-data` library are provided to operate on Smos data.

### Great for version control

Files are made to make git diffs easy and disjoint.
Derived data is never stored, but instead computed or rendered with `smos-report`.

## Default Installation

Clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/NorfairKing/smos
```

### Building with Stack

Use [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) to install Smos with the default configuration:

```
$ stack install :smos
```

#### Troubleshooting on Arch linux

*Do not install `stack` or any other haskell packages using pacman.*
This is unlikely to build at all and will most likely cause in bugs if it does.
Instead, install `stack` by following the documentation [on this page](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install)

### Building with Nix

There are a few relevant targets that you may want to use.
Most likely, you will want to use.

```
$ nix-build nix/release.nix
$ ./result/bin/smos
```

Alternatively, you can also use:

```
$ nix-build -A smos-static nix/release.nix
$ ./result/bin/smos
```

The difference is that the latter will not build and run test suites that are external to the package that they are testing.
These are all the test suites in packages that end in `-gen`.

#### Troubleshooting

When you first run a `smos` executable that has been built with Nix, you may get an error like the following:

```
smos: setupTerm: Couldn't look up terminfo entry "rxvt-unicode-256color"
```

In this case, you can probably solve the problem by setting the `TERM` variable to `xterm`:

```
$ TERM=xterm ./result/bin/smos
```

## Custom installation

Should you wish to change the key controls, you can do this by making your own
little Haskell project (also with stack), define the configuration you want to
use and pass it to the [`smos`](https://github.com/NorfairKing/smos/blob/development/smos/src/Smos.hs#L29)
library function.
